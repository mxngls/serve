## Limitations:

Some worth noting:

- [ ] Types relating to and representing anything HTTP are lacking
- [ ] Error handling could be improved through defining custom error types
- [ ] The logger interface should include a trait 
- [ ] Some options, most prominently the log file path and the directory to
      be served should be configurable
